# Programs

## Program To Swap two numbers

## Extracting First and Last Names
 Write a C# program that prompts the user for their full name and then extracts their first and last names.
 
## Write a C# program that sets up a basic user profile by collecting name, email, and phone number using different data types.

## Write a C# program that modifies a given string by:
* Removing leading and trailing whitespace characters.
* Converting the entire string to uppercase or lowercase (user's choice).
* Extracting a specified substring based on user input (start and end indices).

## Write a C# program that acts as a basic text analyzer.
* It should Accept user input. Allow the user to enter a string (paragraph or text).
* Analyze and report statistics:
* Count the total number of words (consider spaces as word separators).
* Calculate the average word length. Hint. Average word length = Summation of all letters in each word / Total number of words

## Assume you are implementing a Banking Application. Identify entities in the system. Create classes and methods for the various operations in a Bank.

* Use necessary access modifiers and encapsulation techniques to protect the data.
* Use constructors to initialize the objects.
* Use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes.
* Use abstract classes where necessary.
* Simulate some transactions in the application.
